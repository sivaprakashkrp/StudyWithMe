## Welcome to our Whiteboard page 

#### Published on: 2026-02-09

## **How it Works**:

- **Browser-Based & Local Storage:** Drawings are saved directly into your browser's local storage by default. You do not need an account to start, and it works offline.
- **Selection & Creation:** The toolbar allows for basic shapes (rectangles, diamonds, ellipses), arrows, lines, and text.
- **Editing:** Elements can be grouped, locked, or aligned.

## **Key Features**: 

1. Hand-Drawn Style: whiteboard like appearance, making it less formal and more collaborative.
2. Collaborative: Supports real-time collaboration with other users.
3. Export Options: Export drawings as PNG, SVG, or even as JSON for the open format.

## **Credits**:

We have integrated [Excalidraw](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs) into our project.
